# LAB 2

## Aims and Objectives
At the end of this lab session, you are expected to be able to develop simple circuits
using Proteus ISIS designing environment.
### Exercises
1. Using Proteus, implement a circuit to verify the functionality of the two basic
logic gates - AND and XOR
2. Consider the following boolean expression.
Z = A + CB + (A + B')(C' + B)
a. Using Proteus, implement the logic circuit for the above expression without
simplifying.
b. Obtain the truth table for the above expression.
c. Simulate the circuit in Proteus and verify the correctness of the outputs
using the truth table
3. Design a logic circuit for the following situation
A lamp outside a front door comes on automatically when it is dark and someone
stands on the doormat outside the front door. A pressure sensor under the mat
changes from OFF (0) to ON (1) when someone stands on the doormat. The light
sensor is ON (1) when it is light and OFF (0) when it is dark. The lamp can also be
turned on at any time using a switch.
Inputs: Light Sensor
Pressure Sensor
Switch
Outputs: Lamp
