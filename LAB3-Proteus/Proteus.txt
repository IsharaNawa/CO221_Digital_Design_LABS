CO221-Lab3(Proteus)-Used for simulation of circuits,PCB creation

//Create a New Project
File-->New Project-->Give a name-->Specify a location to save-->Create a schematic(default)-->
Do not create a PCB layout-->No firmware project


//Adding Component
Component Mode-->P(Parts)-->Type the name of the part you want to get
**Note that always try to add components that are physically available
**Choose ICs from ls74 series when creating circuits

1.74ls-ICs
**Note that ICs have 3 gates inside in it.(74ls series).Therefore nameing convention of proteus
behave according to that.

2.Animated leds
**To simulate the program

3.Resistors
**220 ohms

4.Inputs
**logic state

5.Power
**Proteus automatically connects power to the IC
